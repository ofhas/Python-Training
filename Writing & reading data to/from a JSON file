# we can also read from a json file like this(remove the #):

#import json
#from pathlib import Path


#data = Path("movies.json").read_text()
#movies = json.loads(data)
#print(movies)

## you can also show a spesific filed in the movies by using print(movies[0], ["title"])
##for example this will present the first movie title which is located in the movies array.
